I am a Ph.D. candidate at the UCLA Spanish and Portuguese Department. I work on the phonetics and phonology of Spanish heritage speakers. I am advised by Ji Young Kim and Victoria Mateu. I am interested in the following research questions:
- How does language develop in future heritage speakers (i.e., early sequential or simultaneous bilingual grammars)? More specifically, how can phonological theory inform cross-linguistic transfer in the speech production of heritage speakers?
- What are the vulnerable areas of phonological development in child and adult heritage speakers? For instance, are phonemic contrasts maintained in heritage speech production? 
- What are the factors that have an effect on cross-linguistic transfer during childhood and adulthood? What is the effect of access to a bilingual education (i.e., relative degree of literacy) and amount of input to the heritae language?

Check out my **teaching** [site](./teaching.md) for a list of courses. 

- I have designed hybrid classes for L2 Catalan learners (with the support of an UCOP ILTI grant). 
- Teaching Catalan as a foreign language has also informed my research. Specifically, I have examined the profiles of L2 Catalan students. This is joint work with Anna Tudela-Isanta, Josep Vidal-Arráez and Ruben Manuel Oronich published in [*Treballs de Sociolingüística*](https://www.raco.cat/index.php/TSC/article/view/374466). A new study on the motivation to learn L2 Catalan has just been accepted by *International Journal of Multilingualism*.

## Projects

- My dissertation project examines **transfer of glottal stop epenthesis in Spanish child heritage speakers** in word external consonant vowel sequences (e.g., un ojo). While resyllabification is the most common strategy to repair syllables without onsets in Spanish (e.g., \[u.no.xo\]), English optionally allows for glottal stop- epenthesis preceding the word-initial vowel (e.g., \[ən.ʔɜg\]). Transfer of glottal stop epenthesis in Spanish would look like this - \[un.ʔo.xo\].  Preliminary results will be presented at the 45th Boston University Conference on Language Acquisition and published on the *International Journal of Bilingualism*. Stay tuned for that! Find here the [slides](https://github.com/gemmarepiso/gemmarepiso.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/resyllabification%20(67).pdf?raw=true) for CASPSLaP 2020.

##### This is a glottal stop produced by a child heritage speaker

- I have recently investigated **Spanish trill production in child heritage speakers and adult heritage speakers**. We found that adult heritage speakers present a higher rate of target-like trills and more occlusions than children. Children produced more tap variants and adults more variants with frication. In addition, trills produced are with more occlusions word-medially than word-initially. This is joint work with Ji Young Kim. The results of this study will appear soon in *Bilingualism: Language and Cognition*.

 - I am also interested in heritage speakers' production of the **Spanish palatal obstruent /ʝ/**. We found that Spanish heritage speakers show an overall high rate of approximant realizations (/j/) and that preceding vowel height and stress have an effect on degree of constriction of the voiced palatal obstruent. Interesteingly, we did not find any correlation with language dominance. This is joint work with Isabel Benvenuti and Ji Young Kim. The results of this study will be published in the *Heritage Language Journal* and have been presentend at the HLS 2019. Check out the [abstract](https://github.com/gemmarepiso/gemmarepiso.github.io/blob/assets-1/Palatal_Fricatives_HLS_2019.pdf?raw=true).
 
 - I have also worked with the **forms and meanings of uptalk in Spanish as a heritage language**. This is joint work with Ji Young Kim. We presented the results of this study at CAPSLaP 2018 and HLS 2017. Ongoing work compares nuclear configurations in Spanish heritage speakers and Spanish speakers residing in Mexico. Stay tuned for that!
